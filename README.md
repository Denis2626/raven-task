Please find the coding puzzle below:

As someone looking forward to being part of a crypto trading company, it is important to have a very basic understanding of how blockchain works. As such, weâ€™ve designed a very small coding puzzle that you will need to solve.

To start the puzzle you will have to find us on Blast Sepolia Testnet at this address: 0x08F8Cc5aDB6940D6c946b89e8baC7A43cd556ff8 and then call view function 0x838ad0ee for the next step.

Rules:
There are no rules, you can use the web and any tool or programming language with which you are comfortable. There is no time limit and the speed of task completion would not affect the end result. We will only judge on a binary basis - i.e. completed or not.

Goal:
Return the transaction hash of the last step.
